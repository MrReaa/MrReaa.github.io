### Here are a lot of funny things

Here is a fun fact:

Who invented the granola bar?
MIT's website credits inventor Stanley
 Mason with creating the first granola bar. 
 This is the guy who invented the first disposable 
 contoured diaper, the squeezable ketchup bottle, 
 and the dental floss dispenser, so it's not hard to 
 picture him coming up with the granola bar.
